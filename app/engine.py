"""
Trading engine -- BTC-spot-trend entry (buys the direction BTC itself
has been trending in, not the previous window's winner or the token's
own cheapness), continuous trailing stop that arms 3 minutes after
window open and tightens above 0.85, a hard stop-loss override once
deep ITM, single trade per window, TP redemption.

See app/config.py for the full strategy write-up, and app/btc_trend.py
for how the trend signal itself is computed. Summary: a short delay
after window open (ENTRY_SETTLE_SECONDS, just long enough for book
data to exist), the engine looks at whatever BTC trend it was last
told about (see on_tick's btc_trend argument, fed by app/state.py from
a BtcTrendTracker that runs continuously off real BTC spot price,
independent of the window clock). If there's no clear trend, the
window is skipped outright. If there is, the target side is UP for an
uptrend or DOWN for a downtrend; if that side's price is below
ENTRY_PRICE_THRESHOLD (0.40), it's bought immediately, flat
BASE_ORDER_SHARES; otherwise no trade is taken this window -- this is
a single check, not a rearmed watch. From then on, TP is live
immediately, but the trailing stop doesn't arm until
TRAIL_START_DELAY_SECONDS (180s / 3min) after the WINDOW OPENED (not
after entry) -- before that, only TP can close the position. The
high-water mark keeps tracking the whole time regardless, so once the
stop arms it starts from wherever price has already gotten to, not
from scratch. Once armed, the stop sits behind the position's
high-water MID -- 0.20 back normally, narrowing to 0.10 back once the
high-water mark has gone above 0.85 -- and only ever tightens.
Independent of that arming delay, the moment the high-water mark
reaches HARD_STOP_TRIGGER_PRICE (0.90), the trailing stop is
permanently deactivated for that position and replaced with a fixed
HARD_STOP_PRICE (0.60) stop-loss -- much wider than the tightened
trail would be, deliberately giving a deep-ITM position room to wobble
without getting stopped out; this never reverts even if price falls
back under 0.90. Mid price is what triggers every decision (entry
threshold, TP, stop), but every actual fill is a real taker execution
priced off real ask/bid order-book depth (see
Engine._realistic_fill_price), so mid and fill price can differ by the
spread. If mid reaches 0.99, redeem at a flat $1.00/share, fee-free,
done for the window. If the trailing stop or hard stop is hit instead,
the position is closed and the window is done -- no flip, no re-entry
on the other side, at most one trade per window. No martingale
anywhere; every entry is BASE_ORDER_SHARES. Every fill except TP is a
taker order and pays the taker fee; TP is the sole fee-free exception
since it's a CTF resolution redemption, not an orderbook trade.
