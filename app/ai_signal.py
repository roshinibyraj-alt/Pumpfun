"""
Lightweight AI signal engine -- a from-scratch logistic regression, no
external ML dependencies (numpy/scikit-learn) and no external API
calls (no Claude/LLM call in the trading-decision path) -- pure
Python, so it's cheap to deploy and fast enough to run every tick.

Predicts P(next window resolves UP) from:
  - RSI(14)
  - 3-candle and 10-candle momentum (% return)
  - 10-candle return volatility (%)
  - the signal candle's own color (the old strategy's entire signal,
    now just one input feature among several)
  - current same-color candle streak length (signed: +3 = 3 green in a
    row, -2 = 2 red in a row)

NO-SKIP MODE: predict() always returns a side (UP or DOWN) whenever
features are available -- there's no "not confident enough" or "not
trained enough" case that blocks a trade. Before the model has any
real training (all weights still zero, e.g. a fresh process with
pretraining unavailable), the raw prediction is an exact 50/50 tie;
in that case it falls back to the signal candle's own color so the
engine still has a deterministic side to act on every window.

Trains via two paths, both feeding the same online weights:
  - pretrain-once at startup on historical Binance data replayed
    through this same feature/window logic (see app/backtest.py) --
    removes almost all of the old "needs live windows to warm up" lag.
  - continuous online learning, one gradient step per window, each
    time a window's true outcome becomes known via record_outcome()
    (called from Engine.finalize_window()).
