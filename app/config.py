"""
Central configuration for the BTC 5-min up/down bot.

Single engine -- one entry attempt EVERY window (no-skip mode).
Direction is decided by an AI signal engine (app/ai_signal.py)
predicting the next window's outcome -- pretrained on historical
Binance data at startup (app/backtest.py) so it isn't starting cold --
and the bot FADES that signal -- it buys the OPPOSITE side of the AI's
prediction (toggle: FADE_SIGNAL, default on):

  1. The instant a new window opens, compute AI features off the
     Binance feed and get a prediction -- the model always returns UP
     or DOWN (no "not confident enough" skip), so the signal is
     decided every window that has candle history.
  2. RSI(14) is computed and logged against the signal side for
     visibility, but does NOT block the trade.
  3. The bot places a resting MAKER limit buy on the FADE side (the
     opposite of the AI's predicted side) @ ORDER_PRICE (0.45). It fills at its own exact price, no
     slippage, no fee, the moment that side's ask drops to/through it.
  4. If the resting order hasn't filled ORDER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS (30s)
     after being placed, it is cancelled and the bot switches to
     TAKER fallback: from then until the window closes, the moment the
     traded (fade) side's best ask is BELOW TAKER_FALLBACK_MAX_PRICE
     (0.60), the bot buys at market (taker) -- priced by walking real
     ask depth, paying the taker fee. If the ask never gets below
     0.60 before the window closes, no trade that window.
  5. No stop-loss. Take profit is fixed at TP_PRICE (0.99) -- a real
     taker sell, priced by walking actual book depth, the moment the
     bid reaches it.
  6. Only one entry, one trade max per window -- no re-arming. If the
     position is open but TP never hits, it is force-closed at window
     end (taker, real depth-weighted price).
  7. Every window's true outcome (once known) is fed back into the AI
     signal engine as one online training step -- it keeps learning
     for as long as the bot runs, whether or not a trade was actually
     placed that window.

The only thing that can skip a window for data reasons is missing
candle history from the live Binance feed (disconnected, or too early
after process startup for the RSI/momentum lookback to be full).
