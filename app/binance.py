Binance public REST 1-minute klines (no API key) -- the minute prices the
strategy reads and the dashboard shows live. Analysis data only; nothing
here prices or executes orders.

A 5-minute Polymarket window opens on an epoch-multiple-of-300s boundary, so
its five 1-minute candles are the Binance 1m candles opening at
open_ts, open_ts+60, ... open_ts+240 (each aligned to a minute boundary).
